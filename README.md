# PRY-BYETYPO

Autocorrects typos in your Pry console.

This small Pry plugin captures exceptions that could be due to typos and deduces the correct command based on your database information.

#### Before

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> Usert.last
NameError: uninitialized constant Usert
from (pry):3:in `__pry__'
```

#### After

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> Usert.last
I, [2024-01-13T20:00:16.280710 #694]  INFO -- : ðŸ¤“ Usert does not exist, running the command with User assuming is what you meant. ðŸ¤“
I, [2024-01-13T20:00:16.281237 #694]  INFO -- : ðŸ¤“  running User.last ðŸ¤“
2024-01-13 20:00:16.345175 D [694:9200 log_subscriber.rb:130] ActiveRecord::Base --   User Load (1.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL ORDER BY "users"."id" DESC LIMIT $1  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<User id: 1, email: "yo@email.com">
```

## Installation


Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile, under the `development` group, by executing:

```
bundle add pry-byetypo
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```
gem install pry-byetypo
```

## Usage

1. Open a PRY console.
2. Start your daily work.
3. Let `pry-byetypo` remove frictions. ðŸš€

## Under the hood

### 1. Byetypo dictionary

When you open a new Pry console, the gem will generate a `byetypo_dictionary.pstore` file containing three pieces of information:

- A list of the ActiveRecord models in your application (e.g. `User`, `Account`).
- A list of the ActiveRecord associations in your application (e.g. `user`, `users`, `account`, `accounts`).
- A timestamp representing the last time the `byetypo_dictionary` was updated. (by default updated every week).

This file is generated at the root of your application by default. If you want to update its location, you can configure the path by adding a `BYETYPO_STORE_PATH` entry in your `.env` file.

### 2. Captured exceptions

#### NameError

This error occurs when you mispelled a model in your REPL. The gem will catch that exception and will try find the closest matches. If so, it will run the command with the (potential) corrected model.

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> Usert.last
I, [2024-01-13T20:00:16.280710 #694]  INFO -- : `Usert` not working, running:
I, [2024-01-13T20:00:16.281237 #694]  INFO -- : User.last
2024-01-13 20:00:16.345175 D [694:9200 log_subscriber.rb:130] ActiveRecord::Base --   User Load (1.0ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL ORDER BY "users"."id" DESC LIMIT $1  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<User id: 1, email: "yo@email.com">
```

#### ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError

Raised when association is being configured improperly or user tries to use offset and limit together with `ActiveRecord::Base.has_many` or `ActiveRecord::Base.has_and_belongs_to_many` associations.

eg:

```ruby
[6] pry(main)> User.joins(:group).where(groups: { name: "Landlord" }).last
ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError: Can't join 'User' to association named 'group'; perhaps you misspelled it?
```

This plugin will look into the `byetypo_dictionary` file to find the closest match and run the correct query.


```ruby
[1] pry(main)> User.joins(:group).where(groups: { name: "Landlord" })
I, [2024-01-13T22:45:16.297811 #1079]  INFO -- : `group` not working, running.
I, [2024-01-13T22:45:16.297972 #1079]  INFO -- : User.joins(:groups).where(groups: { name: "Landlord" })
2024-01-13 22:45:16.319544 D [1079:9200 log_subscriber.rb:130] ActiveRecord::Base --   User Load (1.6ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" INNER JOIN "user_groups" ON "user_groups"."user_id" = "users"."id" INNER JOIN "groups" ON "groups"."id" = "user_groups"."group_id" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL AND "groups"."name" = $1  [["name", "Landlord"]]
=> []
```

#### ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid

The query attempts to reference columns or conditions related to a table, but the table is not properly included in the FROM clause.

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> User.joins(:groups).where(grous: { name: "Landlord" }).last
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: PG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  missing FROM-clause entry for table "grous"
LINE 1: ..."group_id" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL AND "grous"."n...
```

This plugin will look into the `byetypo_dictionary` file to find the closest match and run the correct query.

```ruby
1] pry(main)> User.joins(:groups).where(grous: { name: "Landlord" }).last
I, [2024-01-14T23:50:49.273043 #1248]  INFO -- : `grous` not working, running:
I, [2024-01-14T23:50:49.273177 #1248]  INFO -- : User.joins(:groups).where(groups: { name: "Landlord" }).last
2024-01-14 23:50:49.281956 D [1248:9200 log_subscriber.rb:130] ActiveRecord::Base --   User Load (2.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" INNER JOIN "user_groups" ON "user_groups"."user_id" = "users"."id" INNER JOIN "groups" ON "groups"."id" = "user_groups"."group_id" WHERE "users"."deleted_at" IS NULL AND "groups"."name" = $1 ORDER BY "users"."id" DESC LIMIT $2  [["name", "Landlord"], ["LIMIT", 1]]
```

## Troubleshooting

Pry-byetypo is linked to your development database. During initialization, it will attempt to establish a connection to retrieve the tables available in your project. It will fetch the information for the development environment from the `database.yml` file.

### Unreadable database URL (URI::InvalidURIError)

If the database connection string is not readable, the gem will be unable to establish a connection. If you encounter such an issue, make sure to add a `DATABASE_URL` variable to your `.env` file with the easily readable URL of your database.

### Unreadable connection pool (ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError)

If the number of connections in your pool is not readable, you may encounter an `ActiveRecord::ConnectionTimeoutError`. If you experience this issue, make sure to add a `DATABASE_POOL` variable to your `.env` file.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
